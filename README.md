# TB Mapper

A web app to load data from http://www.who.int/tb/country/data/download/ and display it on WHO-compliant maps.


## Requirements

Rstudio with `shiny`, `dplyr` and [`whomap`](https://github.com/glaziou/whomap) packages installed.


## Use

A quick way of running this code directly from RStudio is to do:
```
> library(shiny)
> runGitHub("tb_mapper", "hazimtimimi") 
```
